Description: This is my Personal Website. It will contain relevant links and documents to represent me at a professional and personal level while highlighting projects and other prospects I want to make public

# Overview

This is desired to be a personal website for general usage. The most common usecase is to be a landing area to point to for people to learn about me whether it be personally, professionally or used as a guide towards other things. It will eventually use this as a link to things for personal learning and education.
